    <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
    <h2>30 January 2017</h2>
    <p>Particular social organizations at Truman use a system for granting rides to their members on weekends to and from a particular set of locations in town. This system will replace the role of the "dispatcher," who recieves requests and then passes on the information to drivers to get the organization members to their destinations. </p>
    <p>The site will perform the following functions: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Members can create an account with a profile</li>
        <li>Users can request a ride from a list of pre-populated locations to a pre-populated location </li>
        <li>Users can specify how many passengers for the ride</li>
        <li>Users can cancel a ride</li>
        <li>Drivers will be assigned requested rides on a first-come, first-serve basis</li>
        <li>Admin users can specify how many drivers and hours of information</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Milestone Links </h2>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="m1/index.html">Milestone 1</a></li>
        <li><a href="m2/index.php">Milestone 2</a></li>
        <li><a href="m3/index.php">Milestone 3</a></li>
        <li><a href="m4/index.php">Milestone 4</a></li>
