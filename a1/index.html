<!--
Create, test and validate an HTML5 document that is the home page of a company that sells lots of different kinds of widgets and gizmos, and is hoping to soon enter the doohickey and whatsit markets.
Your document should include
  images and descriptions of at least three different example products.
  one unordered list, at least
  one ordered list, and at least
  one list that has a nested list within it. You must include
  a table and your table must have at least
    one item that takes up multiple columns and at least
    one item that takes up multiple rows. You should have
  detailed descriptions of products that are stored in
    separate documents and are accessible through
    links from the home document. All the links that you choose to have in your document should point to actual documents (yours or someone else's) that actually exist. -->
